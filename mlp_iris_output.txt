Discussion points for further analysis or improvements:
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., hidden_layer_sizes, activation, solver, alpha, learning_rate)
- Cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance.
- Investigating misclassified samples.
- Feature importance analysis (though less straightforward for MLPs).
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
